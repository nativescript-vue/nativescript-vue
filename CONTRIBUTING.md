# Contributing to nativescript-vue

If you feel like contributing to this project, that is awesome! This guide should help you get started.

# Pull Request Guidelines

- It's OK to submit PR against the `master` branch
- It's OK to have multiple commits per PR (will be squashed during merge)
- Please describe the changes in every PR, to make it easier to review. (No empty PR's please)

We will re-iterate these guidelines as the project matures.

# Development setup
You will need Node.js installed, as well as Nativescript

Please make sure you are using Nativescript 3.0 (3.0.0-rc.2)

[Here is a guide to upgrade](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/nativescript-3.0-release-candidate-available-today)

After cloning the repo, run:

`npm install`

(inside the `nativescript-vue` folder)

# Commonly used NPM scripts

```bash
# watch and auto re-build dist/index.js
$ npm run dev
```

# Testing with the sample application

To test out changes, you will have to link `nativescript-vue` via npm's `link feature`:

Inside the `nativescript-vue` folder run:

`npm link`

This will create a symbolic link in your global node_modules folder, pointing to this location

And then you will have to go into the `vue-sample` folder and run:

`npm link nativescript-vue`

Note: You only need to run this once

If all went well, `node_modules/nativescript-vue` should be a link to your global `node_modules/nativescript` folder, which is is also a link to the actual package.

Finally, you can run the application via:
`tns run android`

If you want to reload the application, every time the `nativescript-vue` module changes, use the `--syncAllFiles` option:

`tns run android --syncAllFiles`
